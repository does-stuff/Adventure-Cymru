2. To run the website, open the folder **within a terminal** and type the following commands

```
$ npm install

```

_\*You may also use `yarn` or `bun`_

3. Visit the localhost address provided in the terminal

```
$ npm run dev

> vite dev

  VITE vx.x.x ready in xxxx ms

```

The address you need to visit is the one containing "localhost" **(may also be 127.0.0.1)**. Most terminals will allow you to control/command click this, however, if that does not work, enter this into your browser's URL bar.
