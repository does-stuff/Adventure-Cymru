# Adventure Cymru: Static

As my website has been selected to be individually reviewed by the exam board, I need to semi-rewrite this website into raw HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I will avoid creating servers with things like `bun`, leaving a pure website. However, due to this limitation, I will not use **components**. Instead, I will create a starting layout file, which includes the HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the Navbar, Footer and Header, and then build the page content out from these individually.
