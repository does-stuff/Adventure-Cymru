# Adventure Cymru: Static

As my website has been selected to be individually reviewed by the exam board, I need to semi-rewrite this website into raw HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I will avoid creating servers with things like `bun`, leaving a pure website. However, due to this limitation, I will not use **components**. Instead, I will create a starting layout file, which includes the HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the Navbar, Footer and Header, and then build the page content out from these individually.

## PLEASE NOTE

I **highly suggest** you take a look at the `main` branch of this repository if you would like to analyse the source code. **This is not the source code.** This website was created using [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev), and this version was created by me downloading each page, cleaning up the HTML and CSS files, re-adding functionality with JavaScript and pushing to the repo. \*\*\*Please check the [`main` branch](https://github.com/does-stuff/Adventure-Cymru) for a more accurate representation of the real work that went into creating this website.

Thank you.
